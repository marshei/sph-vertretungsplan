There are many ways to contribute, you can fork the project and enhance the code base, submitting bug reports or feature
requests and you can help by testing open pull requests. Any help is much appreciated.

## Development

This module is written in Python 3.x

It is recommendable to use an editor with support Python.
For instance [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/).

I have only one account to test with. Please test and share the results or findings.
